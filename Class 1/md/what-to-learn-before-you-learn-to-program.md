# What to Learn Before You Learn to Program

### Or, "how I learned to stop worrying and <3 the computer"

---

# Don't be afraid

- Welcome to your first day of learning to program!

- Believe it or not, every developer ever had this day

- Don't be nervous, we're here to support and help you on your journey!

# Things to keep in mind

- People learn at different paces - just because the person next to you gets the concept, doesn't mean you necessarily will

- Be bullish getting the help you need early on - not in a way to disrupt other students or the instructor, but make sure you don't "fall off the boat"

- There will always be workshopping time in every class - this is where you should ask the most questions. Or ask your mentor

# How to research programming problems

- Getting help from your instructor isn't the only way to increase your learning potential

- Before asking an instructor, try helping yourself - then don't be afraid to get help if you need it!

- Let's take a look together at solving a basic web development problem and how we could tackle looking this up online:

- "How do I make my webpage text bold using CSS?"

# Be ambitious

- Just because you understood what happened in class tonight and were able to write a basic web pageâ€¦

- ...why not go home and create 3 more?

- Programming is one thing in life where you'll get back what you put into it

- Extra practice is a great way to solidify the fundamentals

- If you're not coding right now, somebody else probably is...always be working on projects

# The best way to learn is to teach others

- Outside of your instructors and the internet, one of your best resources is sitting right next to you - your fellow students!

- Asking your fellow students how to do something is mutually beneficial

- One of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to somebody else - so help each other and everyone will benefit

---

# Paired Programming

- Paired programming is a great way to learn!

- Tackle a problem with another student, take turns "driving" the machine for 5-10 minutes at a time

- Two heads are better than one

- You're almost always welcome to tackle problems and exercises in pairs

---

# Re-do assignments

- Students are encouraged to resubmit assignments for further instructor review

- This is a great way for you to add on to your knowledge!

---

# Put in the time

- We understand all of you have jobs, families, and commitments outside of this program.

- To get the maximum benefit of the program however, ensure that you put in a as many hours a week outside of class as you can to make sure you're keeping up with the material

---

# Have fun!

- Programming can make you extremely frustrated, but never forget that the ultimate goal is to give you an amazing toolset to further express yourself to your fellow human beings.

- Keep in mind this ultimate goal as you spend long evenings coding and solving problems =)

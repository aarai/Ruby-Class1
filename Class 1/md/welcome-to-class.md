# On Timing

*Be on time*
Being on time is key to your success! Being early to work on things with your classmates before class begins is even better

Make this month count.


# Treat your classmates with respect

Irrespective of race, gender, etc.

We're trying to create a very inclusive class so everyone can get involved in technology!

# Where to go when you need help

- First stop - your classmates! They're probably struggling as well and you can work through it together

- Your instructor is next up. If class isn't in session, send them an e-mail
